= Diagram Doku Talk: Demo

This is the demo repository for my talk "Diagramm oder Doku - warum nicht beides?"

It contains a Antora site with an github actions configuration.

To showcase how diagrams can serve as a single source of truth, there is a python script included that extracts all additional information from a PlantUML file entered into comments.
